# Launch the extension in a fresh, isolated editor window — none of your
# personal settings, extensions, or login keychain. Loads Jasper from this
# working copy (whatever branch is checked out).
#
# By default the GemStone install root (gemstone.rootPath) is isolated to an
# empty throwaway dir, so the window opens in a clean, brand-new-user state:
# no servers you've downloaded, no stones. Pass --keep-installs (or run
# `npm run dev:fresh:keep-installs`) to reuse your real ~/Documents/GemStone so
# you can connect to existing installs.
#
# We deliberately isolate ONLY gemstone.rootPath and leave HOME untouched, so
# ~/.jasper and ~/.claude.json still resolve to your real home. Reasoning: the
# common case is opening a Claude Code CLI in the integrated terminal to work
# against this fresh window, and isolating HOME would (a) log that CLI out
# (Claude Code keeps auth in ~/.claude.json) and (b) skip Jasper's MCP
# registration entirely — Jasper only writes its MCP entry into an *existing*
# ~/.claude.json, so a throwaway home means no auto-configured jasper MCP. For
# now, keeping the CLI logged in with the MCP server auto-configured is more
# useful than a perfectly pristine home. We may revisit this later (e.g. an
# opt-in --isolate-home flag) if a true brand-new-machine repro is needed.
#
# Usage:
#   npm run dev:fresh                          # clean state, empty workspace
#   npm run dev:fresh -- /path/to/dir          # clean state, open a folder
#   npm run dev:fresh:keep-installs            # reuse your real installs
#   npm run dev:fresh -- --keep-installs /dir  # reuse installs + open a folder
#
# For live reload, run `npm run watch` in another terminal, then reload the
# dev window (Cmd+R / "Developer: Reload Window") after edits.
