# MCP Server

Jasper embeds an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes the
GemStone IDE's query and code-execution surface to AI clients. Tools act on the
**currently active GemStone session** in the owning Jasper window — there are
no separate credentials, no per-database subprocesses, and no off-host
listeners.

## Quick reference

| Surface | Endpoint | Used by |
|---------|----------|---------|
| stdio (via local proxy) | `~/.jasper/mcp.sock` (Unix) / `\\.\pipe\jasper-mcp` (Windows) | Claude Code, Claude Desktop |
| HTTPS/SSE | `https://127.0.0.1:27101/sse` | "Add custom connector" UIs, MCP Inspector, any URL-based client |

Both surfaces are served by the same Jasper window and share the same active
session — what you see from one transport is what you see from the other.

Three Node processes are involved on a typical install:

1. **The Jasper extension host** ([`client/src/mcpSocketServer.ts`](../client/src/mcpSocketServer.ts), [`client/src/mcpHttpServer.ts`](../client/src/mcpHttpServer.ts)) — owns the GemStone session, executes tools, serves both transports.
2. **The proxy** ([`mcp-server/src/index.ts`](../mcp-server/src/index.ts)) — a tiny per-connection Node process that Claude Code/Desktop launch as a subprocess. It connects to Jasper's socket and forwards JSON-RPC frames in both directions. This indirection lets clients that expect a `command + args` stdio server attach to the long-running extension host.
3. **The MCP Inspector** (optional, launched on demand) — a browser UI for poking at the server. Run via the `GemStone: Open MCP Inspector` command.

All three speak the same MCP wire protocol; the difference is just whether the transport is a pipe, a TCP socket, or HTTPS.

## Ownership model

The socket and HTTPS port are global resources, so only one Jasper window can serve MCP at a time. Ownership is decided lazily:

- **On activation**, every Jasper window writes the well-known
  `mcpServers.gemstone` entry into `~/.claude.json` and into Claude Desktop's
  global config. Both entries point at the **fixed** socket path, so they're
  correct no matter which window ends up owning it. No ownership claim is made
  here — a window that opens but never logs in stays passive.
- **On the first GemStone login**, the window that just acquired a session
  attempts to bind the socket and HTTPS port. The successful claimant becomes
  the **MCP owner** for the rest of that VS Code run and writes a sidecar file
  at `~/.jasper/mcp.owner.json` so other Jasper windows can display "Owned by
  /path/to/that/workspace" in their **MCP Server** view.
- **Once owned, the socket stays bound across logout/login cycles.** Tool calls
  during a logged-out gap return "no session selected"; the moment the user
  logs back in, tools resume working. Claude Code's MCP connection never sees
  a disconnect.

This means MCP "follows the work" — the window the user is actually using is
the one the AI talks to.

## Which session does MCP use?

The owning window's **currently active session** — the one selected in the
Sessions view (or shown in the status bar `$(database) <label>` indicator). If
the owning window has two logins, MCP tools act on whichever one is active
*right now*. Switching sessions in the owning window changes which database
the AI sees on the next tool call.

The **MCP Server** view in the GemStone sidebar always shows the live answer:
ownership state, active session, socket path, HTTPS URL.

## Client registration

Three clients are wired up out of the box. Each gets the same `gemstone` entry pointing at the proxy script + socket path.

### Claude Code

- **Config file:** `~/.claude.json` (top-level `mcpServers.gemstone`, user-scope)
- **Written by:** [`client/src/claudeCodeUserMcpConfig.ts`](../client/src/claudeCodeUserMcpConfig.ts)
- **Always on.** The Claude Code CLI is the same on all platforms, so one path covers macOS/Linux/Windows.
- Claude Code snapshots its MCP server list when each session starts. The
  *first* time Jasper writes the entry, any Claude Code session already running
  in that VS Code window won't see it via `/mcp` until it re-activates — Jasper
  detects this case and pops a one-time **"Reload Window"** prompt. Every
  subsequent VS Code launch is silent.
- Stale project-scope `gemstone` entries from earlier Jasper versions (which
  shelled out to `claude mcp add`) are stripped on each activation.

### Claude Desktop

- **Config file (macOS):** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Config file (Windows):** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Config file (Linux):** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Written by:** [`client/src/mcpSocketServer.ts`](../client/src/mcpSocketServer.ts)`#writeClaudeDesktopMcpConfig`
- **Controlled by:** `gemstone.mcp.registerWithClaudeDesktop` (default `true`).
  Set to `false` if you do not want Jasper touching this file.
- The Linux path is the conventional XDG location; an official Claude Desktop
  Linux build does not exist at the time of writing, but the path is the right
  one for community/unofficial builds and for future-proofing.

### MCP Inspector

- Launched on demand by the `GemStone: Open MCP Inspector` command.
- Runs `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` in a dedicated terminal with
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` set so Node's TLS stack accepts Jasper's self-signed
  cert (OS keychain trust does not apply to Node).

### Other clients

Anything that can run an `command + args` stdio MCP server can use Jasper:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemstone": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/extension/mcp-server/out/index.js",
        "--proxy-socket",
        "/Users/<you>/.jasper/mcp.sock"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The proxy script lives at `<extension-install-dir>/mcp-server/out/index.js` —
on a marketplace install that path includes the version, so let Jasper's
auto-registration handle it where possible.

For URL-based clients (Cursor's remote MCP, custom integrations, web tooling),
use the HTTPS/SSE endpoint after trusting the cert (see below).

## TLS for HTTPS/SSE

The HTTPS surface lives on `127.0.0.1` only and uses a self-signed cert that
Jasper generates on first run. The cert is stored in the extension's global
storage directory and is shared across workspaces.

Steps to use:

1. Run `GemStone: Install MCP TLS Certificate` from the Command Palette.
2. Choose **Run in Terminal** (macOS will prompt for an admin password) or
   copy the command and run it yourself. This trusts the cert system-wide.
3. Run `GemStone: Copy MCP Server URL` and paste it into the connector dialog.

Trusting the cert is per-machine, not per-workspace. You only do it once.

## Multiple VS Code windows

Several Jasper windows can run side-by-side, but only one serves MCP at a
time. The passive windows show **"Owned by /path/to/that/workspace"** in their
MCP Server view. To run two MCP-serving windows simultaneously:

- The stdio surface is one-per-machine (fixed socket path).
- Override `gemstone.mcp.httpPort` in the second workspace's
  `.vscode/settings.json` to give it its own HTTPS port. The two windows can
  then both serve HTTPS, but only one serves stdio.

This is intentional. A single AI client should not be routed to two different
GemStone sessions depending on timing — the ownership model makes the routing
predictable and visible.

## Tool surface

The full tool list lives in [`client/src/mcpTools.ts`](../client/src/mcpTools.ts). Roughly, they fall into:

- **Class & method browsing** — `list_classes`, `describe_class`, `get_method_source`, `find_implementors`, `find_senders`, `find_references_to`, `search_method_source`, `get_class_definition`, `get_class_hierarchy`, `export_class_source`.
- **Code execution** — `execute_code`, `eval_python`, `compile_method`, `compile_python`, `compile_class_definition`, `delete_method`, `delete_class`.
- **Session control** — `commit`, `abort`, `refresh`, `status`.
- **Dictionaries** — `list_dictionaries`, `list_dictionary_entries`, `add_dictionary`, `remove_dictionary`, `list_all_classes`.
- **Testing** — `list_test_classes`, `list_failing_tests`, `run_test_class`, `run_test_method`, `describe_test_failure`.
- **Misc** — `set_class_comment`, `list_methods`, `search_method_source`.

All tools share the same query/execution layer as the IDE itself
([`client/src/queries/`](../client/src/queries/)), so the AI sees exactly what
a human looking at the Browser/Inspector would see.

## Limitations

- **Single owner.** Only one Jasper window can serve stdio MCP at a time. This
  is a feature (predictable routing), not a bug to fix.
- **Single session per call.** Tools always act on the owning window's
  currently active session. The AI cannot fan out across multiple sessions in
  one call.
- **127.0.0.1 only.** No off-host listener, by design. Remote AI access would
  require an explicit tunnel (e.g. SSH port-forward) and is the user's
  responsibility.
- **Self-signed TLS only.** No ACME, no user-supplied certs yet — the
  expectation is local-only use.
- **Node.js required on PATH** for the stdio proxy to launch. Most developer
  machines already meet this; bare server installs may not.
- **GemStone on macOS cannot detect stale stoned locks.** This is a GemStone
  limitation, not an MCP one, but it surfaces here because killing/restarting
  the stone affects which session MCP can use. See the **Processes** view's
  *Delete Stale Lock File* action for the workaround.
- **No write-side audit trail.** Tools that mutate state (`compile_method`,
  `delete_class`, `commit`) act with the active session's full privileges and
  leave no Jasper-side log. Use the regular GemStone audit facilities if you
  need one.
