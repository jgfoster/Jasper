# Windows and WSL

Jasper supports two Windows configurations.

## Windows without WSL — Client IDE only

Connect to a GemStone server running on a remote host (or in a VM). No WSL installation is required.

1. Create a login with the remote host, stone name, and NetLDI.
2. On first login, Jasper offers to download the **Windows client distribution** for your GemStone version. This is a small download (~15 MB) containing only the native GCI DLL.
3. After the download, Jasper auto-detects the library and connects.

You can also download client libraries ahead of time using the **Download Windows Client** button in the **Versions** view.

The Versions, Databases, and Processes sections are hidden when WSL is not available, since server management requires a Linux environment.

## Windows with WSL — Full server management

With WSL installed and a Linux distribution configured, Jasper can manage GemStone servers running inside WSL while the VS Code extension runs natively on Windows. The GemStone server distribution is downloaded and extracted inside WSL, while the Windows client distribution provides the native DLL for VS Code to communicate with the server.

### Reaching WSL from Windows

The Windows extension connects to GemStone services (NetLDI) that run inside WSL, so a GemStone login needs a host and a port that Windows can route to. There are three paths, presented in the **OS Configuration** view under **WSL networking**:

1. **Mirrored networking (recommended, Windows 11 22H2 + WSL core 2.0+)** — `localhost` on Windows reaches services bound inside WSL with no further setup. Jasper detects the state and, when NAT is active, offers a one-click **Enable mirrored networking** action that writes `networkingMode=mirrored` to `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig` and prompts to restart WSL.
2. **Stable name via hosts file (Windows 10 fallback)** — Jasper can write `<wsl-ip> wsl-linux` to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. Logins then use `wsl-linux` instead of a raw IP. Because WSL2 assigns a new IP after `wsl --shutdown` or reboot, the action is idempotent and meant to be re-run after any WSL restart. The script self-elevates via UAC.
3. **Copy the IP** — running NetLDI items expose a **Copy Host** context action. Under mirrored networking this copies `localhost`; otherwise it copies the current WSL IP (shown in the item's tooltip). Paste into the login's Host field.

### NetLDI port naming (`gs64ldi`)

Jasper also detects whether `gs64ldi 50377/tcp` is present in `/etc/services` on both sides. With the entry in place, `startnetldi` binds to the conventional port 50377 (instead of picking a random one) and logins can name the port as `gs64ldi`. The **Services** row under OS Configuration offers separate write actions for the Windows and WSL sides — the Windows write needs admin (UAC), the WSL write needs `sudo`.
