# Jasper — A Visual Studio Code Extension for a GemStone Smalltalk IDE

A full-featured GemStone/S 64 Bit development environment for Visual Studio Code. Write, browse, debug, and test GemStone Smalltalk code — and manage your GemStone infrastructure — all from a single editor.

Install from either marketplace:

- **VS Code Marketplace:** https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GemTalkSystems.gemstone-ide
- **Open VSX** (VSCodium, Gitpod, code-server, etc.): https://open-vsx.org/extension/gemtalksystems/gemstone-ide

Jasper works on **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**:

| Platform | Server management | Client IDE (connect to remote GemStone) |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| macOS    | Yes               | Yes                                     |
| Linux    | Yes               | Yes                                     |
| Windows (with WSL) | Yes (via WSL) | Yes                              |
| Windows (no WSL)   | No            | Yes                              |

## Getting Started

### Connecting to an existing GemStone server (any platform)

If you already have a GemStone server running on another machine (or locally), you only need a login configuration and the native GCI client library for your version of GemStone.

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX (links above).
2. Open the **GemStone** sidebar (gem icon in the activity bar).
3. Click the **+** button in the **Logins** section to create a new login.
4. Fill in the connection details: GemStone version, host, stone name, NetLDI, and credentials.
5. Click **Login** to connect.

The first time you log in with a given GemStone version, Jasper needs the native GCI library (`libgcits`) for that version:

- **On Windows**, Jasper will offer to **download the Windows client distribution** automatically. This downloads and extracts the library — no WSL or manual setup required.
- **On macOS/Linux**, the library is included in the GemStone server distribution. If you have a local installation, Jasper auto-detects it. Otherwise, use the **Versions** section to download the distribution for your platform, or point Jasper to an existing library path via the `gemstone.gciLibraries` setting.

### Full local setup (macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL)

To install, manage, and run a GemStone server locally:

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX (links above).
2. Open the **GemStone** sidebar (gem icon in the activity bar).
3. Check the **OS Configuration** section: on macOS/Linux run the shared-memory setup if it warns; on Windows+WSL Jasper also surfaces WSL networking and services-file configuration here.
4. Use the **Versions** section to download and extract a GemStone release.
5. Use the **Databases** section to create a new database.
6. Start the stone and NetLDI from the database tree.
7. Click **Create Login** on the database to generate a login configuration.
8. Click **Login** to connect and start developing.

Alternatively, run **Quick Setup** (button in the Versions view) to do all of the above in one step.

## Windows usage

Jasper runs on Windows in two modes: as a client-only IDE talking to a remote GemStone server, or as a full local server manager backed by WSL. The full Windows/WSL guide — picking a networking mode, writing the hosts file, naming the NetLDI port, the works — lives in **[docs/windows-wsl.md](docs/windows-wsl.md)**.

## Infrastructure Management

Manage your GemStone installation directly from VS Code (macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL).

### OS Configuration

The **OS Configuration** view surfaces every host-level setting GemStone needs, with one-click actions where possible:

- **Shared memory** — checks `sysctl` on macOS, Linux, and WSL, and warns if `shmmax`/`shmall` are below 1 GB. The setup script applies the change immediately and persists it (a `LaunchDaemon` plist on macOS, `/etc/sysctl.d/60-gemstone.conf` on Linux/WSL).
- **RemoveIPC (Linux/WSL)** — verifies that `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` sets `RemoveIPC=no`, so logging out of the session that started the stone doesn't destroy its shared memory segment.
- **WSL networking (Windows only)** — mirrored vs. NAT detection with an action to enable mirrored mode (see _Reaching WSL from Windows_ above).
- **Services (Windows only)** — detects the `gs64ldi 50377/tcp` entry on both sides and offers write actions.
- **WSL distro version (Windows only)** — warns if the default distro is on WSL 1 and provides an **Upgrade to WSL 2** action.

### Version Management

The **Versions** view lists GemStone releases available for your platform (macOS ARM, macOS x86, Linux x86). For each version you can:

- **Download** the release archive from GemTalk Systems
- **Extract** the archive (automatic DMG mounting on macOS, unzip on Linux)
- **Open** the extracted directory in Finder/Explorer
- **Delete** the download or extracted files

On Windows, the **Download Windows Client** button fetches the native client distribution for connecting to remote GemStone servers.

### Database Management

The **Databases** view shows all databases under your GemStone root directory (configurable via `gemstone.rootPath`, default `~/Documents/GemStone`). Click the **+** button to create a new database with a multi-step wizard:

1. Select a GemStone version (from extracted versions)
2. Select a base extent
3. Enter a stone name
4. Enter a NetLDI name

The extension creates the full directory structure (`conf/`, `data/`, `log/`, `stat/`), writes configuration files (`system.conf`, `gem.conf`, stone config), copies the key file and base extent, and writes `database.yaml`.

Each database node expands to show:

- **Stone** — running/stopped status with start/stop buttons
- **NetLDI** — running/stopped status with port number and start/stop buttons
- **Logs** — expandable list of log files (click to open in editor)
- **Config** — expandable list of configuration files (click to open in editor)

Inline buttons on each database provide:

- **Reveal in Finder** — open the database directory
- **Open Terminal** — launch a terminal with all GemStone environment variables pre-configured
- **Create Login** — generate a login pre-filled with the database's connection details
- **Replace Extent** — replace the stopped stone's extent with a fresh base extent (deletes old extent and transaction logs)
- **Delete** — remove the database directory (requires stone and NetLDI to be stopped)

### Process List

The **Processes** view shows all running GemStone processes (stones and NetLDIs) detected via `gslist`, including version, PID, and port information.

Stale processes — where `gslist` reports a `frozen`, `killed`, or `exe deleted` status — are rendered with a red icon and the status prefixed onto the description. A **Delete Stale Lock File** inline action lets you remove the orphaned `*.LCK` after Jasper confirms the recorded PID is either gone or has been reused by an unrelated process. (On macOS, `gslist -c` can't detect a recycled PID on its own, so this manual step is sometimes necessary; see [docs/mcp-server.md](docs/mcp-server.md#limitations) for context.)

### MCP Server view

The **MCP Server** view shows which Jasper window is currently serving MCP tool calls, the active session it's bound to, the socket path, and the HTTPS URL when available. Click **Socket:** or **HTTPS:** to copy the value to the clipboard. See the [MCP Server design doc](docs/mcp-server.md) for the full picture.

## IDE Features

### Logins & Sessions

The **Logins & Sessions** view stores connection configurations for your GemStone databases and shows the live sessions started from each one. Each login specifies:

- GemStone version and GCI library path
- Host, stone name, and NetLDI
- GemStone and host credentials
- Optional per-login export path template

Each login is a row in the tree; click **Login** to start a session, which appears as a child beneath it. A login with no children is idle; a login with children is connected — so the tree itself shows what's running.

**Login rows** offer Edit, Duplicate, Delete, and Login. A login **cannot be edited or deleted while it has an active session** — log out first. **Session rows** (the children) offer:

- **Commit** / **Abort** — transaction control
- **Ping** — confirm the session is still active and responsive
- **Open Browser** — launch the System Browser for this session
- **Logout** — disconnect
- **Export** and **Make Active Session** (context menu)

The active session (used for code execution) is highlighted, and the status bar shows which session is active.

#### Single vs. multiple sessions

By default Jasper runs in **single-session mode**: each login may have at most one session at a time. This keeps a simpler mental model — there is one session, so the active session, the System Browser, and any open workspace can never point at different sessions.

If you need concurrent connections, enable the **beta** multiple-session mode:

```jsonc
// settings.json
"gemstone.sessionMode": "multiple"
```

The only difference is cardinality: a login may now have several session children, and its **Login** action stays available while connected so you can start more.

> **Note:** In multiple-session mode, an open workspace/editor stays bound to the session that opened it even after you switch the active session, so the active session, browser, and an open editor can point at different sessions at once. If you use a custom `gemstone.exportPath`, include the `{session}` variable so concurrent sessions don't overwrite each other's exported files.

### Code Execution

With an active session, execute Smalltalk code from any editor:

| Command | macOS | Windows/Linux | Description |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Display It | Cmd+K D | Ctrl+K D | Evaluate selection and insert result inline |
| Execute It | Cmd+K E | Ctrl+K E | Evaluate selection silently |
| Inspect It | Cmd+K I | Ctrl+K I | Evaluate selection and show result in Inspector |

Long-running expressions show a progress notification with soft-break and hard-break options. The **GemStone Transcript** output channel captures transcript output from the session.

### System Browser

Open with **Cmd+K B** (Ctrl+K B) or from a session's inline button. The browser provides a five-column layout:

- **Dictionaries** — your symbol list dictionaries
- **Class Categories** — classes grouped by category
- **Classes** — class list with hierarchy toggle
- **Method Categories** — method categories with `** ALL METHODS **`
- **Methods** — method selectors

Click a method to view and edit its source. **Cmd+S** (Ctrl+S) compiles changes back to GemStone. Class definitions and comments are also editable.

Context menu operations include:

- Add/delete/rename dictionaries, categories, classes, and methods
- Move classes between dictionaries, reclassify by category
- Drag-and-drop methods to recategorize
- Drag-and-drop classes between dictionaries
- Browse references, senders, implementors, and class hierarchy
- Run SUnit tests on a class

### Object Inspector

The **Inspector** sidebar view displays GemStone objects with drill-down into named and indexed instance variables. Pin objects via **Inspect It** or by clicking globals in the browser. Large collections are paginated.

### Search and Navigation

- **Senders Of** — find all methods sending a selector (editor context menu or browser)
- **Implementors Of** — find all implementations of a selector
- **Browse References** — find methods referencing a dictionary or class
- **Search Method Source** — full-text search across method source code
- **Class Hierarchy** — view superclass chain and subclasses
- **Workspace Symbol** (Cmd+T / Ctrl+T) — search classes and methods across both local files and the active GemStone session
- **Go to Definition** (Cmd+Click / Ctrl+Click / F12) — jump to implementors of a selector or a class definition

### Debugging

When code execution hits an error, a **Debug** button opens the VS Code debugger with:

- Full stack trace with `ClassName >> #selector` frame names
- Click any frame to view its method source
- **Arguments & Temps** and **Receiver** variable scopes with drill-down
- Step Over, Step Into, Step Out, and Continue
- Restart Frame support
- Evaluate expressions in the Debug Console in any frame context

### Breakpoints

- **Line breakpoints** — click the editor gutter in a `gemstone://` method to set/clear breakpoints mapped to GemStone step points
- **Selector breakpoints** — right-click a selector and choose **Toggle Selector Breakpoint** to break whenever that selector is sent; breakpointed selectors are highlighted with a red border

### SUnit Test Runner

The extension integrates with VS Code's native Test Explorer:

- Auto-discovers all `TestCase` subclasses and their `test*` methods
- Run individual tests or entire test classes
- Pass/fail/error results with failure messages
- Test items link to method source

### Jupyter Notebooks (Smalltalk and Grail Python)

Jasper registers two kernels with Microsoft's [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter). Open any `.ipynb` notebook and pick one from the kernel picker; cells execute in the active GemStone session, so notebook code sees — and can modify — the same objects as the System Browser and Display It. Compile and runtime errors appear as cell error outputs.

**GemStone Smalltalk** runs each cell as an independent doit — multi-statement bodies are fine, and the value of the last statement is printed as the cell output. There is no notebook-local variable scope (Smalltalk has no REPL globals concept); state persists the way it does everywhere else in the session, e.g. `UserGlobals at: #x put: ...`, class definitions, and commits.

**Grail (GemStone Python)** requires [Grail](https://github.com/jgfoster/Grail) (GemStone-Python) in your stone:

- Globals persist across cells (Jupyter REPL semantics): `x = 1` in one cell, `x + 2` in the next. Each notebook gets its own module scope within the session, so two open notebooks don't share variables.
- **GemStone: Reset Grail Notebook Scope** (command palette) clears the active notebook's globals — the equivalent of restarting a kernel.
- Without Grail in the stone, running a cell reports "Grail (GemStone-Python) not detected".

### Class Sync (File Export)

Jasper keeps a local mirror of a session's classes as `.gs` files in Topaz format, so VS Code's search, Go to Definition, and find-in-files have something to work with. Files land in `{workspaceRoot}/.gemstone/{host}/{stone}/{user}/{index}-{dictName}/` by default — a hidden directory, keyed by connection target so it's shared across that target's sessions. Override the layout with the `gemstone.exportPath` template setting (variables: `{workspaceRoot}`, `{session}`, `{host}`, `{stone}`, `{user}`, `{index}`, `{dictName}`).

The mirror syncs **incrementally**: Jasper diffs a server-side manifest of per-class hashes against the last sync and re-fetches only what changed, so login/commit/abort stay fast even on a large schema over a slow connection. It's kept across logout (reconnecting re-syncs the difference) and is updated immediately as you edit, so search reflects a change before you commit. A per-login **Sync classes** toggle (on by default) turns the mirror off for slow/remote connections, where server-side search still works.

Exported `.gs` files are **read-only on disk** (`chmod 0o444`) — not for editing. Edit methods through the **System Browser**, which round-trips through the `gemstone://` virtual filesystem and compiles on save. Creating a new `.gs` file under a dictionary directory does still file in a class template; deleting one deletes the class in GemStone.

## Claude / MCP Integration

Jasper exposes its GemStone IDE surface to MCP-aware AI clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, MCP Inspector, and any other client that speaks the protocol). All tools run against the **currently active session** in the window the user is actually working in — no separate credentials, no per-database subprocesses, no off-host exposure.

Two transports are served in parallel:

| Transport | Endpoint | Used by |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| stdio (proxy) | local socket / named pipe | Claude Code, Claude Desktop |
| HTTPS/SSE | `https://127.0.0.1:27101/sse` | "Add custom connector" UIs, MCP Inspector, any URL-based client |

Both Claude Code (`~/.claude.json`) and Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`) are registered automatically when the extension activates, on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The **MCP Server** view in the GemStone sidebar shows which Jasper window is currently serving requests and which GemStone session it's bound to.

To use the HTTPS/SSE surface from Claude Desktop's "Add custom connector" dialog (or any URL-based client), trust the self-signed cert Jasper generates on first run:

1. Run **`GemStone: Install MCP TLS Certificate`** from the Command Palette.
2. Choose **Run in Terminal** (macOS will prompt for an admin password) or copy the command and run it yourself.
3. Run **`GemStone: Copy MCP Server URL`** and paste it into the connector dialog.

For the full architecture (ownership model, multi-window behavior, tool catalogue, limitations, how to wire up other MCP clients), see **[docs/mcp-server.md](docs/mcp-server.md)**.

Disable Claude Desktop registration with `gemstone.mcp.registerWithClaudeDesktop: false`. Override the HTTPS port per-workspace with `gemstone.mcp.httpPort` to run multiple MCP-serving windows simultaneously.

## Language Support

The extension provides language support for three GemStone file formats:

- **Topaz** (`.gs`, `.tpz`) — Topaz command language with 40+ commands (`run`, `doit`, `printit`, `method`, `classmethod`, etc.) and embedded Smalltalk
- **Tonel** (`.st`) — Rowan package manager format with STON metadata headers
- **Smalltalk** — bare Smalltalk for browser documents and scratch files

All formats include:

- Syntax highlighting (TextMate grammars)
- Semantic token highlighting (LSP)
- Hover documentation
- Autocompletion
- Go to Definition and Find References
- Document and workspace symbols
- Code formatting with configurable options
- Diagnostics
- Code folding

The Smalltalk formatter has eleven knobs under `gemstoneSmalltalk.formatter.*` (spacing, line wrapping, continuation indent, etc.). The VS Code Settings UI shows every option live; the full reference is in **[docs/formatter.md](docs/formatter.md)**.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `gemstone.rootPath` | `~/Documents/GemStone` | Root directory for GemStone installations and databases |
| `gemstone.gciLibraries` | `{}` | Map of GemStone versions to GCI library paths |
| `gemstone.exportPath` | `""` | Root path for class file export (supports `{workspaceRoot}`) |
| `gemstone.maxEnvironment` | 0 | Method environments to display in browser |
| `gemstone.sessionMode` | `single` | Concurrent sessions allowed: `single` (default) or `multiple` (beta — reveals the Sessions panel) |
| `gemstone.mcp.httpPort` | 27101 | Port on 127.0.0.1 where Jasper serves the MCP HTTPS/SSE surface |
| `gemstone.mcp.registerWithClaudeDesktop` | true | Auto-register the gemstone MCP server in Claude Desktop's global config |

> **Tip:** VS Code's Quick Open file search (Cmd+P / Ctrl+P) and the title bar search respect `.gitignore` by default, so exported `.gs` files in gitignored directories won't appear in search results. To include them, set `"search.useIgnoreFiles": false` in your VS Code settings. If there are some ignored things you want to continue to exclude, you can tell VS Code to exclude certain paths with the `files.exclude` setting.

## GCI Library

The extension communicates with GemStone databases using the GemStone C Interface (GCI) thread-safe library (`libgcits`), loaded at runtime via [koffi](https://koffi.dev/). The library path is resolved in this order:

1. **Auto-detected** from extracted distributions (server or Windows client) matching the login's GemStone version
2. **Configured** per-version in the `gemstone.gciLibraries` setting
3. **Prompted** — on Windows you are offered an automatic download; on all platforms you can browse to the library manually

The Windows client distribution exports a subset of the full GCI interface — non-blocking login and debug-attach functions are not available, but all standard session operations work normally.
