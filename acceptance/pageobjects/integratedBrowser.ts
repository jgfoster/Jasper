/**
 * Page Object over VS Code's Integrated Browser (1.109+), which replaced the
 * iframe-based Simple Browser — `simpleBrowser.useIntegratedBrowser` now defers
 * to it, which is why no "Simple Browser: Show" command exists any more.
 *
 * It is a real Chromium WebContents, not a frame of the workbench, so it is its
 * own page in the Electron context and can be driven like any other Playwright
 * page: full DOM, real assertions on what a page actually rendered.
 *
 * That distinction matters, because looking for it the obvious way finds
 * nothing: `window.frames()` is empty, since a separate WebContents is not a
 * frame. Reach it through `context().pages()` instead.
