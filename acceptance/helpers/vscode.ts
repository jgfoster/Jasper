 * A Playwright fixture that gives each test a live VS Code window with Jasper

 * Non-disruptive on macOS: the moment the app is up we switch it to the
 * "accessory" activation policy — the runtime equivalent of LSUIElement — and
 * hide it. An accessory app has no Dock icon and never becomes the active
 * application, so its window can't steal focus or sit on your desktop while you
 * work. Playwright drives it over CDP, which is unaffected by any of that.
 *
 * Isolated from your own machine — not just VS Code's settings:
 *   - a fresh user-data dir (no personal settings, theme, or window state)
 *   - a fresh extensions dir (only Jasper loads)
 *   - a throwaway workspace folder
 *   - HOME pointed at the profile, so `~/.claude.json` and `~/Documents/GemStone`
 *     resolve to empty throwaway paths (no MCP write to your real config)
 *   - `gemstone.rootPath` at an empty temp dir, so the Versions and Databases
 *     panels never surface your real GemStone installs
 *   - secrets kept in an in-profile file store, never the macOS login keychain
 *
 * Fixtures:
 *   - `workspaceSettings` — seeds the workspace's `.vscode/settings.json` before
 *      launch (override with `test.use({ workspaceSettings })`) to declare
 *      logins, GCI library paths, etc. Its keys win over the isolation defaults.
 *   - `window` — the workbench page, ready to drive (`.monaco-workbench` present)
