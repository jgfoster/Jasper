// A GemStone Smalltalk tutorial delivered as a Jupyter notebook, modelled on
// Prof Stef (the classic in-workspace Smalltalk syntax tutorial). The lessons
// are adapted for a notebook: instead of a single workspace with
// `ProfStef next` navigation, each lesson is a Markdown cell followed by one or
// more runnable code cells — run each with Shift+Enter (or the ▷ button) and
// its result appears beneath it. A closing "Introduction to GemStone" section
// covers what makes GemStone different from other Smalltalks: the persistent,
// shared, transactional object repository.
//
// The notebook is built programmatically (not shipped as an .ipynb) and opened
// as an untitled document, so running its cells never dirties a file bundled
// with the extension — the same rationale as the untitled Getting Started
// workspace (see workspace.ts).

`Hello! This notebook is a hands-on tour of **GemStone Smalltalk**, adapted from the classic *Prof Stef* tutorial.

**Before you start:**
1. Choose the **GemStone Smalltalk** kernel (top-right of this notebook).
2. Make sure a GemStone session is logged in (the *GemStone Logins* view — *Add a Login*, then connect). Cells run against the selected session.

**How to use it:** read a lesson, then run the code cell beneath it with **Shift+Enter** (or the ▷ button). The result — the \`printString\` of the last expression — appears below the cell. Text written to the \`Transcript\` shows up in the **GemStone Transcript** output panel.

Edit any cell and re-run it — experimenting is the whole point. Let's begin.`,

`The \`Transcript\` is a global output stream — the Smalltalk "console". Writing to it does not change a cell's result; instead the text appears in the **GemStone Transcript** output panel (View ▸ Output ▸ *GemStone Transcript*), which comes forward when it receives output.

\`show:\` writes a string; \`cr\` starts a new line.`,

`Objects are **instances** of a class. Usually you send \`new\` to a class to create one. An \`OrderedCollection\` is like an Array whose size can grow and shrink.

`The debugger is one of Smalltalk's signature tools. When code raises an unhandled error, GemStone can open a debugger *on the live, suspended execution* — you inspect variables, evaluate expressions in context, edit the method, and continue.

Notebook cells report an error inline rather than opening the debugger. To experience the debugger, use **Debug It** on an expression in a GemStone Workspace, or run failing code there — for example \`nil foo\` or \`self halt\`. Jasper offers both a VS Code debugger and an Enhanced (Smalltalk-style) debugger.

Run the cell below to see how an error is reported here.`,

`You now know the Smalltalk *language*. What makes **GemStone/S** different from other Smalltalks is where the objects live.

In most Smalltalks your objects live in an in-memory *image* that belongs to one process. In GemStone they live in a **persistent, shared, transactional object repository** on disk that many sessions connect to at once. A few consequences worth understanding:

- **Persistence by reachability.** Anything reachable from a *persistent root* survives after your session ends — no save/load, no serialization. \`UserGlobals\` and \`Globals\` are such roots (symbol dictionaries).
- **Transactions.** Your session sees a stable snapshot. \`System commitTransaction\` publishes your changes to everyone; \`System abortTransaction\` discards them and refreshes your view. Nothing you do is permanent until you commit.
- **Shared and multi-user.** Classes, methods, and data are all in the repository, visible to every session (subject to security). Many users work in the same object space.
- **Sessions.** You are logged in as a *UserProfile*; \`SessionTemps\` holds per-session scratch state that is never committed.

Run these read-only cells to look around. (This lesson changes nothing permanent — it ends with an abort.)`,

`That's the tour. You've run Smalltalk expressions; met numbers, strings, symbols, arrays, and blocks; learned message precedence and cascades; iterated over collections; used reflection; and seen what GemStone's persistent, shared, transactional repository adds on top of the language.

**Where to go next:**
- Open a **Workspace** (command: *GemStone: Open Getting Started Workspace*) for free-form experimenting with *Display It*, *Inspect It*, and *Debug It*.
- Browse the image in the **System Browser** and the **Globals Browser**.
- Re-run this tutorial any time from the command *GemStone: Open Tutorial Notebook*.
