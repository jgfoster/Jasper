 * class — the same flow the Explorer's ivar-row pencil drives.
 *
 * Simple-but-polite (Eric, 2026-07-21): the Refactor… menu offers the action on
 * any identifier; when the word is NOT an instance variable of this class, a
 * warning toast says what it is instead — inherited (rename belongs to the
 * defining class) or not an ivar at all (use Rename Temporary/Argument) — the
 * mirror image of the temp/arg rename declining in the other direction.
