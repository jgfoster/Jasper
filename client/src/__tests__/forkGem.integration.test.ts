/**
 * Forking a gem, against a live stone.
 *
 * The unit tests pin the Smalltalk this builds, but only a stone can say
 * whether GemStone accepts it — and it did not, at first: `GsTsExternalSession
 * newDefault` assumes the NetLDI is called `gs64ldi`, so the fork failed with
 * "ERROR 2710, NetLDI service 'gs64ldi' not found" against a stone whose NetLDI
 * is named anything else (which is most of them, including this one). Setting
 * `gemNRS:` is what fixes it, and this test is what keeps it fixed.
 *
 * The forked gem runs a one-second sleep and exits on its own, so nothing is
 * left behind holding a session.
