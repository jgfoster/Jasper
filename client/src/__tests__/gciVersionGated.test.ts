/**
 * Build-time gate for GemStone 3.6.2 compatibility.
 *
 * Some GCI functions were added after 3.6.2 (see the gcits.hf diff of 3.6.2 vs
 * 3.7.5). gciLibrary.ts binds those through `optionalFunc(...)`, which tolerates
 * their absence so Jasper still loads and logs in against 3.6.2 — but calling
 * one on a 3.6.2 server throws "<name> is not available in this GCI library".
 *
 * Against a 3.7.5 dev image those bindings succeed silently, so it's easy to
 * introduce a dependency on a post-3.6.2 function without noticing. This test
 * makes that a CONSCIOUS decision: if production code calls one of the gated
 * functions and it isn't in ALLOWED_POST_362 below, the test fails and tells
 * you to opt in explicitly (which is then a reviewable diff).
