/**
 * Server-side installation of the Jasper refactoring engine.
 *
 * Thin client wrapper over the server-side `GsRefactoringLoader` — the single
 * source of truth for the load mechanism, which the by-hand topaz runbook
 * (`gs-src/refactoring/LOADING.md`) drives too. The client only has to:
 *   1. file in the loader class (`refactoring-loader.gs`), then
 *   2. send `GsRefactoringLoader loadFromServerDir: <payloadDir>`.
 * The loader does the rest inside the gem: create the dedicated `GsRefactoring`
 * dictionary, file in the AST substrate / feature-detected compat backports /
 * engine / manifest in dependency order, run a completeness check, and
 * COMMIT on success or ABORT on any failure. So — unlike the Enhanced Inspector
 * installer — this module never commits: the loader owns that decision, and we
 * just surface its report.
 *
 * Why server-side `GsFileIn` rather than client-side per-method compilation: the
 * AST payload alone is ~60 classes / ~1,200 methods. `GsFileIn` compiles each
 * file inside the gem in ~one call, so the extension host stays responsive.
 *
 * The engine installs the compat backports as extensions on kernel classes, so
 * the session passed here must have write access to them — in practice a
 * SystemUser session (the caller sets that up; this module is agnostic about
 * how the session was obtained).
 *
 * Server-side file-in requires the gem to read the files, i.e. share a
 * filesystem with them (a local stone). Remote stones are detected and reported
 * rather than failing cryptically.
 *
 * Unlike the Enhanced Inspector, refactoring support is NOT version-gated: the
 * engine and loader are built to load on every supported release (3.6.2 through
 * 3.7.5+). The only version-dependent choice here is the `GsFileIn` signature
 * used to file in the loader class itself (see `installRefactoringSupport`).
