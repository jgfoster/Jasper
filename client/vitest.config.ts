//   - 'default' : the default suite (unit tests + the automatic GCI test that
//              uses useIntegrationTest). This is what `npm test` runs.
//   - 'gci'  : the on-demand GCI suite (src/__tests__/gci/** and
//              src/__tests__/repro/**). It shows up in the panel and can be
//              run interactively, but is deliberately kept OUT of `npm test`
//              (the "test" script pins --project default). Run it with
